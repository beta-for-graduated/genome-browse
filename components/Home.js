    The cultivated rice, Oryza sativa L., is one of the major food sources for the world and a model organism in plant biology. The rice pan-genome, the genome of rice species rather than an individual, has been constructed from 3K rice genomes with a medium sequencing coverage about 15X. This pan-genome contains ~370Mbp IRGSP genome and ~260Mbp novel sequences, which are almost the same size as an individual rice genome.

    This database provides:

    Basic information of 3,010 rice accessions
    Sequences and gene annotations for the rice pan-genome
    Gene presence-absence variations (PAVs) of rice accessions
    Expression profiles for rice pan-genome
    This database also provides:

    Basic search functions:
    Search a single gene to obtain its basic information, distributions, PAVs and gene functions
    Search a single rice to obtain its sequencing landscape and meta-information (source, classification, etc.)
    Search sequence(s) against pan-genome sequences
    Advanced search functions:
    Search multiple rice accessions to obtain their shared genes
    Search multiple genes to obtain rice accessions where they all present
    Visualization functions:
    A tree browser to view the phylogeny of 3K rice accessions
    A genome browser to view gene annotation and presence-absence variations (PAVs)
